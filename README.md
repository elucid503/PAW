# PAW
Website for the St. John's Prep Performing Arts program.

# Why?
The website that previously existed for the program was messy at best. The best representation is a built-from-scratch website that is clear and useful.

# How?
The website is built in two sections seperating the backend API with the frontend site. The site calls the backend API to get real-time images and album data.
